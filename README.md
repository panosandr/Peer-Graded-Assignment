Getting and Cleaning Data - Week 4 Project

The R script named run_analysis.R performs the following: 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The text file named tidydata.txt contains the end result 

The markdown file named CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data
